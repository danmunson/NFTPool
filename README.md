- Supports multiple "rarity" tiers so prizes can be distinguished based on value
- Randomness provided by the Chainlink VRF Oracle
- Pool can be entirely user operated, or served by a third part with the help of meta-transactions
- Built-in tokens can be dispensed from the pool and later exchanged for draws
- Optional fee system in place for operators
